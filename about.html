            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>AI Security Observer was founded to bridge the gap between technical vulnerability research and executive-level security strategy. As Artificial Intelligence becomes integrated into every layer of the enterprise, the "Attack Surface" is expanding faster than traditional defenses can keep up.</p>
            
            <p>This project documents the transition from <strong>Blue Team</strong> defensive configurations to <strong>Red Team</strong> adversarial testing. By analyzing frameworks like the <strong>NIST AI RMF</strong> and <strong>OWASP Top 10 for LLMs</strong>, this newsletter provides actionable insights for securing the next generation of technology.</p>
