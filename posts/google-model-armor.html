            <h2>Google Cloud Debuts "Model Armor" to Firewall AI Prompts</h2>

            <h3>What happened</h3>
            <p>Google Cloud has introduced a new security tool called Model Armor. This tool acts like a firewall but instead of blocking bad internet traffic it blocks bad conversations with your AI.</p>
            <h3>Details</h3>
            <p>Model Armor sits between the user and the AI model (like Gemini or GPT).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How it works:</strong> It reads every message the user sends and every answer the AI gives. If it sees a "jailbreak" attempt (someone trying to trick the AI) or sensitive data (like a social security number) leaving the AI, it blocks it instantly.</li>
                <li><strong>Policy Control:</strong> Security teams can set simple rules like "Block all mentions of Project X" or "Stop any hate speech," and Model Armor enforces it automatically.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>"Prompt Injection" (tricking AI) is incredibly hard to fix. Model Armor is important because it doesn't rely on the AI being smart enough to say "no." It uses a separate security guard to stop the bad stuff before it even reaches the AI. This is a massive shift toward "defense in depth" for AI.</p>
            <h3>My Take</h3>
            <p>This is basically a bouncer for your AI club. Instead of asking the AI to "please be nice" you have a big security guard Model Armor standing at the door checking everyone's ID. It is the most realistic way to stop hackers right now because it doesn't trust the AI to protect itself.</p>
