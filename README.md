# AI Security Observer 🛡️🤖
**Tracking the intersection of AI, Cybersecurity, and Red Teaming.**

## Project Overview
AI Security Observer is a professional cybersecurity publication hosted on GitHub Pages. Originally started as a student blog for **Lindenwood University**, the project evolved in Phase 2 into a scholarly resource focused on the transition from defensive (Blue Team) to offensive (Red Team) AI security operations.

### Key Features
- **Featured Capstone:** Deep-dive analysis of Red Teaming LLMs.
- **BLUF Summaries:** "Bottom Line Up Front" boxes designed for executive-level readability.
- **Resources Page:** Curated links to the NIST AI RMF and OWASP Top 10 for LLMs.
- **Dark Mode Aesthetic:** A custom CSS theme designed for the cybersecurity niche.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Frontend Development:** Custom HTML5 and CSS3 (Flexbox, responsive design).
- **Security Research:** Application of NIST and OWASP frameworks to Generative AI.
- **Adversarial Testing:** Documentation of prompt injection and context-ignoring attacks.

## Human-AI Collaboration
This project was developed in collaboration with **Gemini (Google AI)**. AI was utilized for:
1. **Pair Programming:** Debugging relative file paths and CSS layouts for the "Hero" section.
2. **Content Strategy:** Brainstorming realistic adversarial prompts for security guides.
3. **Documentation:** Assisting with APA 7th Edition citations and project reflection.
