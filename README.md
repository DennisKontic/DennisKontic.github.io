# AI Security Observer 🛡️
**A Cybersecurity Portfolio tracking AI vulnerabilities and defensive scaling.**

## Overview
This project is a professional-grade prototype built for the **Fundamentals of Applied AI** course at Lindenwood University. It demonstrates the transition from Blue Team automation to Red Team adversarial testing in Generative AI systems.

## Key Features
- **Featured Capstone:** Technical guide on Red Teaming LLMs.
- **BLUF Summaries:** Optimized for executive-level communication.
- **Resources:** Direct links to NIST and OWASP AI frameworks.
- **Responsive Dark Mode:** Custom CSS designed for the cybersecurity aesthetic.

## Human-AI Collaboration
Developed in partnership with Gemini AI. AI was utilized for:
1. **Pair Programming:** Debugging Flexbox layouts and GitHub folder routing.
2. **Strategy:** Simulating adversarial prompt injection scenarios.
3. **Refinement:** Polishing content for professional clarity and APA 7 accuracy.
